        <p>
          <h5 className='font-bold'>1. No Refund Option: </h5>As we offer
          industry-based projects that involve collaboration with external
          partners, all project fees are non-refundable. Once a student commits
          to a project and makes a payment, there will be no option for a
          refund.
        </p>

            2. Commitment to Deliver Quality Projects:
          </h5>
          Studoindustry strives to provide high-quality industry projects that
          align with the students&#39; academic and career goals. We work
          diligently to connect students with reputable industry partners and
          ensure meaningful learning experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5 className='font-bold'>3. Project Matching and Confirmation:</h5>
          When a student expresses interest in a specific project and is matched
          with an industry partner, it indicates a commitment to participate
          fully in the project. After confirmation, students are expected to
          actively engage and contribute to the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5 className='font-bold'> 4. Continuous Support:</h5> We offer
          ongoing support to ensure a positive and rewarding experience for
          students throughout the project duration. Our team is available to
          address any concerns, provide guidance, and facilitate smooth project
          execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5 className='font-bold'>5. Change of Circumstances:</h5> While
          project fees are non-refundable, we understand that unforeseen
          circumstances may arise. If a student encounters any exceptional
          circumstances that may affect their ability to participate in the
          project, they are encouraged to reach out to our support team to
          discuss potential solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5 className='font-bold'> 6. Cancelation of Projects:</h5> In rare
          cases where a project is canceled due to unforeseen circumstances on
          the industry partner&#39;s end, we will make every effort to offer an
          alternative project or compensation to the affected student(s).
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5 className='font-bold'>7. Dispute Resolution:</h5> If there are any
          disputes or concerns regarding our refund policy or the project&#39;s
          execution, students can contact our customer support team. We will
          handle such matters professionally and strive to find a fair
          resolution.
        </p>
